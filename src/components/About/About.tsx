          Hi, Iâ€™m Bobbie. I am a UX designer with over 12 years experience
          working in healthcare and wellness promotion. I have seen many
          problems in the healthcare industry, many of which I strongly believe
          can be solved through technology and functional design. I want to
          solve these problems, using my compassionate nature in caring for
          others, creative ability, and passion for research and design.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.text}>
          My current position is at a healthcare start-up company where I work
          as a virtual nurse. I work alongside the PYM team. I am excited to
          expand my research and design-thinking skills, and to create
          functional products and services to make the world a better place, one
          happy user at a time.
        </p>
